# A UI sketching template for pen and paper prototypes for games on the Playdate console

Initially, I've started developing Playdate games right in VSCode, but then had to make a step back to actually design the games with pen an paper before diving into the UI.

So, I created a little sketch template that I want to share here, including PSD, PDF, PNG and JPG.

Have fun
